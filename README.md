# Neural Networks(Back Propagation)
Back Propagation Algorithm. The aim of this code is to show the logic behind this algorithm. 
Idea behind BP algorithm is quite simple, output of NN is evaluated against desired output. 
If results are not satisfactory, connection (weights) between layers are modified and process is repeated again and again until error is small enough.
